# Vimmy

Vimmy is a Vi/Vim quick reference tool and "cheat sheet" for users of the popular editor. It is not a complete guide to every possible Vi/Vim command, but rather an easy to use compilation of the most commonly used functions. As you've probably seen, many reference books have been written for this editor. Instead of trying to cram hundreds of pages of information into a cluttered and messy interface, I designed Vimmy to be a quick and easy to use companion for the average Vi/Vim user. The colorful interface is intuitive and simple, and is divided into easy to navigate categories like "Moving Around", "Entering Text", "Search and Replace", etc. Best of all, it's FREE! If you see something you'd like added, email me and I'd be happy to accommodate your request.
